# FlareOn-10 partial writeup

Flare-On is a difficult reverse engineering challenge organized by Mandiant every year. FlareOn 10 was held for 6 weeks in Fall 2023. 

This folder contains a high level overview of the process I followed to solve the challenges [here](WriteUp.md). And a more in-depth discussion on how to handle the last challenge along with both python and IDC scripts to debofuscate the challenge [here](DeobfuscatingChal13.md).
